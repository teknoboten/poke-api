## Docker

I finally have a laptop capable of running Docker (🎉!) so have been experimenting with containers. So if you have Docker Desktop installed, you can join the container party with these steps:

### 1. clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/teknoboten/poke-api

### 2. change to the /express directory (where the Dockerfile lives)

        cd poke-api

### 3. build your docker image

        docker build . -t express-pokedex

### 4. run it!

        docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 -d express-pokedex

### 5. test it:

         curl -i localhost:9000

if everything worked, you should get the following response:
