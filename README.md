## Docker
I finally have a laptop capable of running Docker (üéâ!) so have been experimenting with containers. So if you have Docker Desktop installed, you can join the container party with these steps:



### 1. clone this repo
        git clone git@github.com:teknoboten/catch-em-all.git catch-em-all

### 2. change to the /express directory (where the Dockerfile lives)

        cd catch-em-all/express


### 3. build your docker image

        docker build . -t express-pokedex

### 4. run it!

        docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 -d express-pokedex

### 5. test it:

         curl -i localhost:9000

if everything worked, you should get the following response:

```
